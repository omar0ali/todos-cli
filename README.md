# Todos CLI Application
Just a simple CLI application that organizes all the tasks for a specific project, this works pretty much on any folder, it will create a json file which will be used as a storage for all the tasks created. The application is very simple to use, since I used [cobra] library to make a nice cli application.

Here is a list of functions it can do.

1. Create tasks
2. Edit tasks
3. Delete tasks
4. Change status of a task
5. Display a all list of tasks
6. Display in-progress tasks
7. Display finished tasks
8. Display created tasks

## Project Objective
I am trying something new, when creating a new project, I was thinking of having why not to use some cli app, and wondered it would be cool that each one of these project to have some kind of todos or tasks and they are saved wihtin each of these project so each will have there own tasks for isolation.


## Personal Objective
I made this application just because I wanted to learn a cobra library and practice a little bit of golang. I really like the language and I want to get comfortable with it a little bit. This project isn't big, its small and simple and covers a varity of concepts of golang and cobra library.

### Setup

There would two ways, either downloading the binary version or compiling from source code.

- Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar0ali/todos-cli.git
```

Change path

```bash
cd /todos-cli
```

### Usage

TODO: Here should be an explaination of how to use the application
