# Todos CLI Application
Just a simple CLI application that organizes all the tasks for a specific project, this works pretty much on any folder, it will create a json file which will be used as a storage for all the tasks created. The application is very simple to use, since I used [cobra] library to make a nice cli application.

Here is a list of functions it can do.

1. Create tasks
2. Edit tasks
3. Delete tasks
4. Change status of a task
5. Display a all list of tasks
6. Display in-progress tasks
7. Display finished tasks
8. Display created tasks

## Project Objective



## Personal Objective
I made this application just because I wanted to learn a cobra library and practice a little bit of golang. I really like the language and I want to get comfortable with it a little bit. This project isn't big, its small and simple and covers a varity of concepts of golang and cobra library.

### Usage

TODO: Here should be an explaination of how to use the application
